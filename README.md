## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn & practise Rust, so the solutions are not necessarily the most efficient or idiomatic.

## Usage

To run a solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin dayXX
```

where `XX` is the day number.

For example, to run the solution for day 1, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin day01
```
